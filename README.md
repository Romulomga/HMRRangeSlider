## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

```ruby
iOS 8 or later
```

## Installation

HMRRangeSlider is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'HMRRangeSlider'
```

Note that this control uses IB_DESIGNABLE, so for it to work well and not get warnings in Interface Builder, you should use the latest version of CocoaPods, and add the `use_frameworks!` line. So your podfile may look something like

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
use_frameworks!

pod “HMRRangeSlider”
```
